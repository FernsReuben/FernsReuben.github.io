# Projects

Here is a list of a few projects that I've worked on

## [DnD companion](./projects/DNDCompanion/dnd.html)

*   Created to mostly help my Dungeons and Dragons campaigns. 
*   Easy tool that has a dice feature as well as a text box function to save and keep track of story events.
*   Written in Javascript using the P5.js libraries. 

## [Poller](https://github.com/FernsReuben/Poller)
*   Abandoned due to hosting issues as it was a project done by cash strapped college students, but the github is still present.
*   PHP and SQL based app representing a survey website that rewards surey takers with points which they can use to turn into real life prizes.
*   Worked with large databases, where people's names, addresses, payment information were meant to be kept secure. 
*   A lesson on security when designing databases.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

The final element.
